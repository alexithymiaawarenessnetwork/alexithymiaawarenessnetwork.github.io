# Alexithymia Diagnosis and Comorbidity

Alexithymia is not classified as a standalone psychiatric disorder but rather as a personality trait or construct that can significantly impact mental health and well-being. Understanding its assessment, characteristics, and relationship with other conditions is crucial for proper identification and treatment planning.

**Key Points:**
- Alexithymia is measured dimensionally rather than categorically
- Multiple validated assessment tools are available for evaluation
- Strong associations exist with numerous psychiatric and medical conditions
- Comorbidity patterns inform both diagnosis and treatment approaches
