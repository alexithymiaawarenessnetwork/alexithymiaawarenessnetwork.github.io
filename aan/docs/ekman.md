# Ekman's Basic Emotions

Paul Ekman's theory of basic emotions is one of the most influential frameworks in emotion research. Based on extensive cross-cultural studies of facial expressions, Ekman identified six universal basic emotions that appear to be biologically hardwired and recognized across all human cultures.

## The Six Basic Emotions

Ekman's research identified six emotions that are universally recognized through facial expressions:

### Happiness
**Description**: Feelings of joy, contentment, satisfaction, and pleasure
- **Facial Expression**: Genuine smile (Duchenne smile) involving both mouth and eyes
- **Physical Signs**: Raised cheeks, crow's feet around eyes, upturned mouth corners
- **Function**: Signals social bonding, cooperation, and positive experiences
- **Triggers**: Achievement, social connection, pleasant experiences, humor

**Variations in Intensity:**
- Mild: Contentment, satisfaction
- Moderate: Joy, pleasure
- High: Euphoria, elation, ecstasy

### Sadness
**Description**: Feelings of loss, disappointment, grief, and sorrow
- **Facial Expression**: Drooping eyelids, downturned mouth, raised inner eyebrows
- **Physical Signs**: Tears, slumped posture, reduced energy, slower movements
- **Function**: Signals need for support, promotes social bonding through empathy
- **Triggers**: Loss, failure, separation, unmet expectations

**Variations in Intensity:**
- Mild: Disappointment, melancholy
- Moderate: Sadness, grief
- High: Despair, anguish, depression

### Anger
**Description**: Feelings of frustration, irritation, rage, and hostility
- **Facial Expression**: Lowered brow, tightened lips, flared nostrils, intense stare
- **Physical Signs**: Muscle tension, clenched fists, raised voice, forward lean
- **Function**: Motivates action to overcome obstacles, establishes boundaries
- **Triggers**: Injustice, frustration, threats, blocked goals

**Variations in Intensity:**
- Mild: Irritation, annoyance
- Moderate: Anger, frustration
- High: Rage, fury, wrath

### Fear
**Description**: Feelings of anxiety, apprehension, terror, and alarm
- **Facial Expression**: Wide eyes, raised eyebrows, open mouth, tense face
- **Physical Signs**: Rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, muscle tension
- **Function**: Prepares body for fight-or-flight response, promotes survival
- **Triggers**: Perceived threats, danger, uncertainty, phobias

**Variations in Intensity:**
- Mild: Unease, concern

- **Triggers**: Contamination, moral violations, offensive stimuli

**Variations in Intensity:**
- Mild: Distaste, aversion
- Moderate: Disgust, revulsion
- High: Loathing, abhorrence

### Surprise
**Description**: Feelings of astonishment, amazement, and wonder
- **Facial Expression**: Raised eyebrows, wide eyes, dropped jaw, open mouth

- **Function**: Focuses attention on unexpected events, prepares for action
- **Triggers**: Unexpected events, novel information, sudden changes

**Variations in Intensity:**
- Mild: Mild surprise, interest
- Moderate: Surprise, astonishment
- High: Shock, amazement, bewilderment

## Research Foundation

### Cross-Cultural Studies
**Methodology:**
- Studied facial expressions across diverse cultures
- Included isolated populations with minimal Western contact
- Used both recognition and production tasks
- Validated findings across multiple research teams

**Key Findings:**
- Universal recognition of the six basic emotions
- Consistent facial expressions across cultures
- Similar emotional triggers and responses
- Evidence for biological basis of emotions

### Neurobiological Evidence
**Brain Research:**
- Distinct neural pathways for each basic emotion
- Amygdala involvement in fear processing
- Facial nerve patterns consistent with expressions
- Evolutionary continuity with other primates

**Physiological Markers:**
- Unique autonomic nervous system patterns
- Specific hormone and neurotransmitter profiles
- Consistent muscle activation patterns
- Cross-species similarities in expression

## Facial Action Coding System (FACS)

### Development and Purpose
Ekman developed FACS to systematically measure facial expressions:
- **Objective measurement** of facial muscle movements
- **Action Units (AUs)** corresponding to specific muscle contractions
- **Reliable coding** of emotional expressions
- **Research and clinical applications**

### Key Action Units for Basic Emotions
**Happiness:**
- AU 6: Cheek raiser
- AU 12: Lip corner puller
- AU 25: Lips part

**Sadness:**
- AU 1: Inner brow raiser
- AU 4: Brow lowerer
- AU 15: Lip corner depressor

**Anger:**
- AU 4: Brow lowerer
- AU 5: Upper lid raiser
- AU 7: Lid tightener
- AU 23: Lip tightener

**Fear:**
- AU 1: Inner brow raiser
- AU 2: Outer brow raiser
- AU 5: Upper lid raiser
- AU 20: Lip stretcher

**Disgust:**
- AU 9: Nose wrinkler
- AU 10: Upper lip raiser
- AU 25: Lips part

**Surprise:**
- AU 1: Inner brow raiser
- AU 2: Outer brow raiser
- AU 5: Upper lid raiser
- AU 26: Jaw drop

## Applications for Alexithymia
