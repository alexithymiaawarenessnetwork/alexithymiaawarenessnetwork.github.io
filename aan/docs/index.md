# Introduction to Alexithymia

If you've never heard of Alexithymia, you're in good company. The condition, originally described by Peter Sifneos in 1973, is characterized by a difficulty in identifying and describing emotions.

## What is Alexithymia?

Alexithymia literally means "no words for emotions" (from Greek: a = lack, lexis = word, thymos = emotion). People with alexithymia have difficulty:

- Identifying and describing their own emotions
- Distinguishing between emotions and physical sensations
- Understanding the emotions of others
- Expressing emotions appropriately

## Why AAN Exists

The Alexithymia Awareness Network (AAN) exists to educate the public about Alexithymia and to provide resources for those who may be affected by it. We believe that increased awareness and understanding can help individuals better navigate their emotional experiences and improve their quality of life.
