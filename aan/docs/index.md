# Welcome to the Alexithymia Awareness Network

**Bridging the gap between emotions and understanding**

The Alexithymia Awareness Network (AAN) is dedicated to increasing awareness, supporting research, and providing resources for individuals affected by alexithymia‚Äîa condition that affects how people identify, understand, and express emotions.

## What is Alexithymia?

Alexithymia, from the Greek meaning "no words for emotions," is a psychological construct characterized by:

- **Difficulty identifying emotions** - Trouble recognizing what you're feeling
- **Difficulty describing emotions** - Struggling to put feelings into words  
- **Limited emotional awareness** - Reduced ability to distinguish between emotions and physical sensations
- **Externally-oriented thinking** - Focus on external events rather than inner emotional experiences

Affecting approximately **10% of the general population**, alexithymia can impact relationships, mental health, and overall quality of life.

- **Increase awareness** of alexithymia in the general public and healthcare communities
