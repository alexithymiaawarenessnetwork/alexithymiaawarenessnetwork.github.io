- Indicate difficulty with emotional awareness and expression
- Not a diagnosis or pathology
- Suggest areas for potential development
- May benefit from targeted interventions

**Moderate Scores:**
- Some challenges with emotional processing
- Selective difficulties in certain areas
- May benefit from awareness and skill building
- Consider specific subscale patterns

**Low Scores:**
- Good emotional awareness and expression
- May still benefit from emotional skill development
- Consider other factors affecting emotional well-being
- Useful baseline for future comparison
